            <h3>WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU</h3>
            <p>
              CAFE ROBOT Meet-ups are intimate and small and we try to stick to a maximum number of 15 people per event, with changing
              locations. If you have a location in mind or would love to host us for a couple of hours for any evening during
              the week, give us a shout. Here some pointers what we are looking for: Relatively city-center in Amsterdam, cosy
              (not an office), a bit crazy or different, rather trashy than too posh. We also donâ€™t really have a budget, so
              that was that (a briefing as easy can be). :)
