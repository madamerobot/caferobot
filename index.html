          group of web developers, who like to nerd out but <br>
          don't get lost in the stars. Welcome to the first <br>

                    As you might know, a huge amount of web developers is self-tought. Nobody learnt anything the 'right way' and luckily survived
                    by winging it. In this meet-up, we put a lot of focus on being inclusive for any level of experience.

                      Hi there, modest fellow! We also very much appreciate more experienced web developers to join our event and help out with any questions. 
                      All of us had to start somewhere, right?
                  </p>

                  <p>
                      Yes, we've all been there. By calling this the 'first non-awkward Tech-Meetup', we really try to facilitate conversations, introduce 
                      you to people who could be helpful for your questions and are willing to crack 1-5 silly jokes to make you feel better.
                  </p>

                  <h3>What is your hidden agenda?</h3>
                  <p>
                      Great news: There is none. I decided to start this meetup to create an inclusive community for (future) web-developers in Amsterdam. 
                      I very much aim to keep this event-series small and personal, to encourage helpful conversations and the opportunity to make some new friends.

                <p>
                  CAFE ROBOT Meet-ups are intimate and small and we try to stick to a maximum number of 15 people per event, with changing
                  locations. If you have a location in mind or would love to host us for a couple of hours for any evening during
                  the week, give us a shout. Here some pointers what we are looking for: Relatively city-center in Amsterdam, cosy
                  (not an office), a bit crazy or different, rather trashy than too posh. We also donâ€™t really have a budget, so
                  that was that (a briefing as easy can be). :)
